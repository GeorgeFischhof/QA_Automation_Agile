**The Team**

Practically The Team is the smallest unit from the outer world's point of view.

The Team has the responsibility. There is no personal responsibility.

If someone is stuck somewhere, the Team helps him / her to go forward. (As you could see in films: no one is left behind) But of course the Team must know about the event.

Learning in the team is possible and encouraged. If someone do not know something they ask the other members.

**Communication in the Team**

As the agile manifesto ( [http://agilemanifesto.org/](http://agilemanifesto.org/) ) says:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

the communication is very important. In the team, and outside of the team

Progress indicators:

-   In the team we use daily stand-ups to know the progress of other members. Whether they are on track: what they do, what will they do, is there any obstacle in their way.
-   As a non-verbal communication element we use task-board. Every team members maintain the board according to their progress.

Interactions:

We are a Team.

Anyone can ask the other member, or the whole team. And we answer the question according to our knowledge and when we are able to answer.

**The task-board**

The board is divided into columns representing a given state of the task. (basic columns: To Do, In Progress, Done) According to our progress we move the tasks from left to right.

The To Do column contains the tasks in prioritized order (set by customer or product owner). The top most task has the highest priority, so we, as a team, have to solve then from top to bottom.

As a team member everyone takes the task that they able to solve (can be different than the top-most one, if they not able to solve that one, but someone from the must take the top-most one too).

The board shows the overall progress and is viewed by all stakeholders: team members, product owner, project manager, sometimes the customer too.

**Communication outside the team**

Demo:

The demo is team's communication towards to customer. During the demo the team proudly shows their progress. The customer or product owner can ask things during the demo. (Even they can tell their concerns about the demoed stuff.)

Something is wrong:

We all can make mistakes.

There is only team responsibility. No one can be asked personally about the mistake

**The Scrum Master**

The Scrum Master is responsible for the

-   good work environment
-   smooth working of the team

He / she

-   removes the obstacles / or take appropriate actions for removing obstacles
-   holds the ceremonies (Master of Ceremony)
-   coaches the team for to be more performant
-   protects the team from impacts of events from outer world

Here is a funny video about scrum masters ;-)

===============

The methodologies

Scrum:

-   fix period sprints
-   the sprint backlog (items selected by the team for the period of the sprint) are protected, unchangeable
-   sprint is planned ahead
-   no work-in-progress limit, any of the tasks committed to sprint can be in work-in-progress state, the priority is from top to down
-   grooming: best practice: 2-3 sprints are broke down to refined backlog items, grooming sessions: about one hour per week (if BDD is used, then about 2 hours a week). Participants: product owner (PO) (and/or proxy PO and/or business analyst plus the development team
-   ceremonies: sprint planning, daily standup, grooming, demo, retrospective
-   backlog item related definitions (not mandatory, but used almost always):  
    definition of ready: when a task or backlog item can be put to working board, the development team accepts task only if it complies to definition of ready)  
    definition of done: when can the team consider the backlog item to be done (the product owner accepts the task / backlog item if it complies to definition of done)

Kanban:

-   no sprints
-   the work-in-progress items are protected
-   no sprint, no planning ahead, we plan the tasks at hand only
-   work-in-progress (WIP) limits are used, WIP limits controls the work, if the limit is reached, no new task can be moved to that given state; people who have no task, or wants to move task to that state must resolve the (move forward) task(s) from the give state before they add their own to that state (free up the state)
-   no grooming
-   no ceremonies

Scrumban (mix of scrum and kanban, anything can be mixed, here I will write a mix that we used successfully at one of my former workplaces, little bit modified because of small daily working time):

-   semi sprints: 2 weeks sprint like working, see below
-   the items in sprint backlog column are semi protected: only not started functions can be touched, started functions will be finished, only decision based changes
-   rough time estimates: we try to collect tasks for two weeks, to roughly know what will be finished et the end of sprint. The task at hand is planned, but only divided to subtasks, no time estimation refinement
-   work-in-progress (WIP) limits are used
-   grooming as needed, and as we can - decision based. Participants: maybe reduced audience will work well: PO, and proxy PO)
-   ceremonies: rough sprint planning, daily standup, grooming, demo, retrospective
-   definition of ready: we will use common understanding. Definition of done: we will use some checkpoints
