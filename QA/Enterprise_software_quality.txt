ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE QUALITY

Its a highly important feature for any software or a product and is based upon dozens of non functional requirements and metrics. Software quality comes in two types : external and internal. Without a good quality, software gets rusty and creates issues in team's process as well as the software product itself.

In USA itself poor quality softwares, applications and products have wasted 2.8 trillion USD in 2020. Hence software quality is highly important and effective which makes customers happy, gets high returns on investment on existing digital product.

HOW TO ACHIEVE SOFTWARE QUALITY

1. Static Code Analysis
2. Code Reviews
3. Merge Checks
4. Software Design Considerations
